# Hi 👋, I'm Angel Flores

### Senior IT Systems & DevOps Engineer

Senior IT Systems and DevOps Engineer with **5+ years of experience** designing, deploying, and operating **production infrastructure** across **enterprise and mid-sized business environments**. Strong background in **on-prem infrastructure**, **containerized platforms**, **secure network architectures**, and **automation-driven delivery pipelines**.

Founder and operator of **Tickrtxt.com**, an **algorithmic trading SaaS platform** serving **160+ active users**. I architected and deployed the platform end-to-end on **on-prem Kubernetes (k3s)**, securely exposed to the internet using **Cloudflare Tunnel**. The system is fully containerized with **Docker** and delivered through **CI/CD pipelines implemented with GitHub Actions**, enabling reliable and repeatable deployments.

- 🔭 Currently building **Tickrtxt.com** — a production SaaS platform  
- 🌱 Currently learning **Terraform** to formalize infrastructure as code

### What I’m Building

- **Production SaaS Infrastructure**  
  Architecting, deploying, and operating a live SaaS platform with real users, uptime requirements, and secure external access.

- **On-Prem Kubernetes Platforms**  
  Managing containerized workloads using **k3s**, with a focus on availability, scalability, and operational simplicity.

- **Automated CI/CD Pipelines**  
  Designing and maintaining **GitHub Actions** workflows for build, test, and deployment automation.

### Other Professional Projects

**Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) Implementation — Twingate**

Designed and implemented a **Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)** solution for a **mid-sized organization**, modernizing remote access and eliminating reliance on traditional VPNs.

- Provisioned and administered **Linux virtual machines** to host **Docker-based Twingate Connectors**
- Deployed and maintained connectors using **Docker** for high availability and secure service access
- Defined and enforced **resource-level access policies** for internal applications and services
- Integrated **Single Sign-On (SSO)** with centralized identity providers
- Implemented **role-based access control (RBAC)** to restrict access by user group and role
- Enforced **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** to strengthen identity security

**Impact:** Reduced network attack surface, improved access control, and enabled secure remote access to internal resources without exposing the network publicly.

### What I Care About

- **Reliable Infrastructure** — systems that are stable, observable, and scalable  
- **Security-First Design** — zero-trust networking, least-privilege access, and MFA  
- **Automation & Repeatability** — CI/CD and infrastructure as code to reduce manual effort  
- **End-to-End Ownership** — design, deploy, operate, and continuously improve systems
