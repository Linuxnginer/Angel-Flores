# Hi 👋, I'm Angel Flores

### Senior IT Systems & DevOps Engineer

Senior IT Systems and DevOps Engineer with **5+ years of experience** designing, operating, and supporting **production infrastructure** across **enterprise and mid-sized business environments**. I specialize in **on-prem infrastructure**, **containerized platforms**, and **automation-first delivery pipelines**.

I am the founder and operator of **Tickrtxt.com**, an **algorithmic trading SaaS platform** serving **160+ active users**. I designed and deployed the platform end-to-end on **on-prem Kubernetes (k3s)**, securely exposed to the internet using **Cloudflare Tunnel**. The platform is fully containerized with **Docker** and delivered through **CI/CD pipelines built with GitHub Actions**.

- 🔭 Currently building **Tickrtxt.com** — a production SaaS platform  
- 🌱 Currently learning **Terraform** to implement infrastructure as code

### What I’m Building

- **Production SaaS Infrastructure**  
  Architecting and operating a live SaaS platform with real users, uptime requirements, and secure public access.

- **On-Prem Kubernetes Platforms**  
  Managing containerized workloads on on-prem hardware using k3s.

- **Automated CI/CD Pipelines**  
  Designing reliable GitHub Actions workflows for build, test, and deployment automation.

### What I Care About

- **Reliable Systems** — infrastructure that is stable, predictable, and scalable  
- **Security by Design** — zero-trust exposure and minimized attack surfaces  
- **Automation First** — reducing manual work through CI/CD and IaC  
- **End-to-End Ownership** — build it, ship it, run it, improve it
