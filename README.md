# Hi 👋, I'm Angel Flores

### Senior IT Systems & DevOps Engineer

DevOps and Systems Engineer with **5+ years of experience** designing, operating, and scaling **production infrastructure** across **enterprise and mid-sized environments**. Strong focus on **reliability, security, and automation**, with hands-on ownership of live SaaS platforms.

Founder and operator of **Tickrtxt.com**, an **algorithmic trading SaaS** with **160+ active users**, built and maintained end-to-end. The platform runs on **on-prem infrastructure**, securely published using **Cloudflare Tunnel**, and is fully containerized and orchestrated with **Docker and k3s (Kubernetes)**. I design and maintain **CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions**, ensuring safe, repeatable, and automated deployments to internet-facing services.

- 🔭 Building **Tickrtxt.com** — production SaaS & algorithmic trading platform  
- 🌱 Learning **Terraform** to formalize infrastructure as code and improve reproducibility

### What I’m Building

- **Production SaaS Infrastructure**  
  Designing and operating a real-world SaaS platform with active users, uptime requirements, and secure public access.

- **On-Prem + Cloud-Native Systems**  
  Running Kubernetes workloads on on-prem hardware while leveraging modern cloud tooling for security, delivery, and observability.

- **Automated Delivery Pipelines**  
  CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions for container builds, testing, and controlled deployments.

### What I Care About

- **Reliable Systems** — infrastructure that is stable, predictable, and scalable  
- **Security by Design** — private networks, zero-trust exposure, minimal attack surface  
- **Automation First** — reducing manual work through CI/CD and infrastructure as code  
- **End-to-End Ownership** — build it, ship it, run it, improve it
